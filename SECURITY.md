# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

The Awesome NestJS list is a curated collection of links to external resources. While we don't handle sensitive data directly, we take the security of our community seriously.

### If You Find a Security Issue

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of the linked resources:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. **Contact the maintainers** of the affected project directly
3. **Optionally**, let us know so we can update or remove the link

### Reporting Malicious Links

If you find that a link in this list leads to:

- Malware or malicious content
- Phishing websites
- Compromised repositories
- Abandoned projects with known vulnerabilities

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/nestjs/awesome-nestjs/issues/new?template=report-issue.yml) or contact the maintainers immediately.

## Our Commitment

We commit to:

- ✅ Reviewing reported security concerns promptly
- ✅ Removing or updating problematic links
- ✅ Running automated link checks weekly
- ✅ Maintaining the integrity of the curated list
